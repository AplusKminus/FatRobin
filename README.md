# FatRobin 🐦
**Practical PERT dosing—no guesswork, no math errors.**

**FatRobin** is a precision calculator for people managing pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT). Whether you’re estimating pills for your meal, breaking down a food package, or figuring out how much you can safely eat with your available pills—FatRobin handles the math.

## ✅ What It Does

- Calculates how many enzyme pills you need **for a portion, package, or unit**.
- Shows how much fat a pill covers based on entered data.
- Supports multiple pill strengths (10k, 35k out of the box).
- Offers **3 calculation modes** depending on what info you have.
- Rounds results safely (up for pills, down for fat coverage).

## 🧠 Calculation Modes

Use **any** of these. Results appear as you enter data:

1. **Direct Weight**  
   *“This portion weighs 300g. How many pills do I need?”*

2. **Package Division**  
   *“This package weighs 800g and has 4 servings. What’s the dose per serving?”*

3. **Food Units**  
   *“I eat 1 slice at a time. What's the dose per slice?”*  
   You can enter weight per unit, or total units in a package—FatRobin auto-completes the rest.
