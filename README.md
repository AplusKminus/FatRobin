# FatRobin 🐦

**Making enzyme dosing simple and accurate**

FatRobin is a practical companion app for people managing pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT). Whether you're calculating how many pills you need for a meal or figuring out how much fat you can safely consume with your current pills, FatRobin eliminates the guesswork and math errors that can impact your comfort and health.

## Why FatRobin?

If you or someone you care for needs digestive enzymes with meals, you know the drill: read nutrition labels, calculate fat content, figure out portions, do the math for enzyme units, and hope you got it right. Get it wrong, and you might face uncomfortable digestive issues or feel restricted in your food choices.

**FatRobin solves this by doing the calculations for you, quickly and accurately.**

### The Two Ways You'll Use FatRobin

#### 📊 **Planning Your Meal** 
*"I want to eat this. How many pills do I need?"*

Enter the fat content per 100g, total package weight, and your planned portion size. FatRobin instantly tells you exactly how many 10k or 35k unit pills you need.

#### 🍽️ **Planning Your Portion**
*"I have these pills. How much fat can I safely eat?"*

See at a glance how many grams of fat each pill type covers, helping you plan portions or choose between different foods with confidence.

## Perfect For

- **Parents** managing their child's enzyme therapy
- **Adults** handling their own PERT regimen  
- **Caregivers** helping elderly family members
- **Anyone** who wants to eat with confidence and avoid calculation errors

## How It Works

FatRobin uses the standard enzyme-to-fat ratio that your healthcare team has established. The app:

- ✅ **Always rounds up** pill calculations (because taking too little can cause problems)
- ✅ **Always rounds down** fat coverage per pill (for safety margins)
- ✅ **Validates your inputs** to prevent calculation errors
- ✅ **Works instantly** - no internet connection required

## Real-World Examples

- Pizza has 11g fat per 100g
- Large pizza weighs 800g
- You want 3 slices (about 300g)
- FatRobin instantly shows: "You need 2 pills of 35k units"

**Scenario 2: Snack Planning**
- You have 1 pill of 10k units

- Perfect for choosing between snack options

**Scenario 3: Restaurant Dining**
